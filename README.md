# Backlog

- âˆšrunning in node.js

- abstract all system-specific into system.cljs library
- database-abstraction backed on leveldb and indexeddb

- testing
- improve key-value-database
- also compile + test node version
- related-server up and running
- restructure repositories

## Later

### Website

  - android-app https://crosswalk-project.org/
    - possibility also to run a thread on rhino - to have access to android api
  - cordova iOS etc.  - chrome extension
  - opera extension

## Repository Plan

Main repositories

- `solsort` - source code for cloud
  - `notes.md` - various writings: notes and release-status, will be automatically extracted and transformed from markdown
- `webroot` - static files for the webserver
- `gateway` - gateway server, which starts webrtc-server, connects nodes, and forward http to nodes, proxies couch-base-access etc.
- `loader` - boot-javascript that caches code in localstorage, and autoupdates etc.
- repositories for building individual projects

## Distributed System
Distributed system
- node
  - DB-thread
  - UI-thread
  - worker threads
- everything coordinated via distributed database, 
  - all state saved there
  - coordination 
    - idle-workers are listening on (wait-get :local :next-task) and (wait-get :local worker-id), and then compare-and-swap to take job
    - communication are done via changes in storage, - most cached in memory, and messages send between threads immediately when db-change
- database: key-value stores, each store distributed in a number of buckets each belonging to a set of nodes
- storage
  - owner/manager manages bucket-placements, and timestamp for entire db
  - owners
  - buckets
  - redundency level
  - bucket-fn (key `->` bucket it belongs to)
- bucket
  - owner/manager - timestamps commits
  - owners
  - key-values
  - key-subscriber-tree-of-trees
- initial stores: 
  - `local` - single bucket on local computer, no replication
  - `topology` - contains network information, 1 bucket per key corresponding and hosted on each host, no replication
- topology levels
  - process (containing ui-thread, db-thread and worker-threads)
  - processes on same machine/same-internal-ip
  - same external ip
  - same zone
- computer type
  - peer
    - indexeddb
    - cryptography
    - webrtc-peer
    - webworkers/thread-pool
  - pseudo-peer
    - as peer, but no webrtc-peer, so proxied through peer
    - cannot be bucket-owner except for local/non-replicated
    - either no-webrtc, often working offline, or running on battery
  - client
    - essentially only ui-thread running
- commit-levels
  - locally sent
  - committed in local db-thread
  - committed in bucket-member
  - committed in bucket-owner
  - committed in all buckets
- client-api storage-keys
  - get key [max-age] `->` value (possibly cached)
  - (get-and-lock storage keys [timeout]) `->` result-map, put-function
  - wait-get key (similar to subscribe, channel returning non-nil value if possible or waiting for write)
  - subscribe key 
  - unsubscribe key
  - local-fn - applies function on key/val in bucket, ie. inc, dec, push, pop, compare-and-swap, set-if-nil, ...
- client-api storage
  - open
  - map - run named function w/ optional data along
  - reduce incl.  - get-all - get-all-keys - get-all-values
  - subscribe
